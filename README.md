Hey Santa, I looove the card! I think DataScience@UL-FRI should consider adopting this new logo, at least every December. I like how your wishes reference the Mandalorian, but you really made me smile with the last page. :D Such a nice, personal touch. You must know me well! ;) Happy holidays!

Dear Santa! Thanks so much for the ornaments. I was thinking of not setting up a tree in my student flat this year, but this gift pipped the decision tree the other way! Have a merry Xmas! ‚ù§Ô∏è
