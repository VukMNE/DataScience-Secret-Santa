# DataScience Secret Santa 2020
According to the newly established tradition at DataScience masters programme of University of Ljubljana, this year's Secret Santa will be organized in slightly different fashion.

We have been told by our pre-decessors, now second year students of DataScience, that they have thrown a party and created an amazing experience for both students and professors. However, with respect to the situation with Sars-CoV-2 epidemic, we will not be able to gather in-person. Since, we didn't want to be the ones that break the chain, this years Secret Santa, will be special, because everyone of us will send Christmas cards through post.

# Concept
If you are not familiar with the concept of Secret Santa, here is how it works:

Each person is assigned to an anonymous secret santa that prepares a gift for them. Well in our case, gifts are going to be data science-related Christmas cards with very nice data science Christmas wishes.âœ¨

# How to participate

First, fill out a Google Form (**link here**) by **December 1st**, where you will leave your address, so that the anonymous Santa can send you the greeting card.

Then, on December 2nd, each participant will be assigned a person that they need to send their gifts(greeting card) to. Since we would like to have no negative experience for all of our participants, we would like to point out that the gifts/greeting cards should **NOT** exceed 10â‚¬ in value.

Cards should be sent before 15th of December. If a person's address that you are required to send is not in Slovenia, we recommand sending it a few dazs before, so that the package arrives in time.

After all this is done, you can sit back, relax and wait for a greeting card to arrive at your door ðŸ¥³. If you are willing to share, you can take the picture of the greeting card that you received, and publish it here, under the /gallery folder.
