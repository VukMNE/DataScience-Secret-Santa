## Erik Å trumbelj
Thanks to my Secret Santa for a wonderful gift! And to the organizers for their work!

Feedback:

* Rafaello: Great! (You know your audience!)
* Sure, they are only pie charts, but even they deserve better color choice!
* Packaging: Perfectly sized and robust!
* Text: Don't use "at least" with an interval (*at least 6-8* makes no sense; use *at least 6* instead).
